I'm Nipun Goyal, Data Scientist at [Canada Energy Regulator (CER)](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/). I've studied Data Science and Machine Learning from University of British Columbia, based in Vancouver, Canada. My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks. I am currently working on OCR text extraction from British Columbia Flooding Images to create impactful geo-spatial dataset. Outside of work, I take keen interest in Formula 1, Snooker, House Music and Stock Markets & Finance.
